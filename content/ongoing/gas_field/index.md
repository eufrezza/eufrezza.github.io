abstract: Natural gas is the main energy source of Bangladesh. While not considered a resource rich country, Bangladesh experienced significant gas discoveries, allowing it to minimize its dependence on imported natural energy sources. In this paper, we investigate how discoveries of natural gas reserves across Bangladesh affect education at the local level, exploiting the spatial and cohort variation. Results show that younger cohorts exposed to the gas reserves are more likely to be educated. The effects are similar for males and females.
